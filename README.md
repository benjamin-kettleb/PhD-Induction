# PhD-Induction
This is a repositry to learn about Git and GitHub for my PhD in Geophysics titled "Deformation from continental volcano-tectonic interaction". 

I have attached my solutions to the first 3 problems from project Euler. I completed this back in 6th Form college and have just attached them to help me understand how Git Hub works.

Also attached are links for some of the papers that I read whe I was applying to this PhD. As time goes on I will also add a short summary of each.
